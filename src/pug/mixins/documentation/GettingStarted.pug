  h3.mt-n5(data-anchor) Quick start
  p Looking to start your project quickly? Just unzip the 
    code #{theme}.zip
    | . We have precompiled and packaged everything in the 
    code public
    |  directory for you. Start editing the 
    code pages/starter.html
    |  with a text or code editor, save it, and open the file in your favourite browser to see the changes.
    
  
  h3.pt-5(data-anchor) Setting up Build system
  p Unzip the 
    code #{theme}.zip
    |  to any folder and open a command line or terminal at that location.
    | Sparrow's dev tools require 
    a(href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank') Node
    |  and 
    a(href='https://git-scm.com/' target='_blank') Git
    |  . If you do not have them in your machine, please install their latest stable version from their corresponding website. As you have 
    span.fw-black.text-black Node and Git installed and accessible from your terminal or command line
    | , install 
    a(href="https://gulpjs.com/" target='_blank') Gulp CLI
    |  package 
    |  globally with the following command:
  pre
    code.lang-html.
      npm i gulp-cli -g
  
  p.mt-4 When you’re done, install the rest of the sparrow’s dependencies with:
  pre
    code.lang-html.
      npm i
  
  p.mt-4 Now run:
  pre
    code.lang-html.
      gulp
  
  p.mt-4 Running gulp will compile the SCSS, transpile the javascript, copy all required libraries form 
    code node_modules
    |  to the corresponding 
    code public/assets/vendors 
    |  directory and will open a browser window to 
    code public/index.html
  p All of the following folders are monitored for changes, which will tell the browser to reload automatically after any changes are made:
  +ComponentCardLib
    | public/assets/video/
    | public/assets/img/
    | public/vendors
    | src/pug/
    | src/scss/ 
    | src/js/
  

  p.mt-4 Now you can edit any 
    code pug
    |  file from 
    code src/pug
    | , change SCSS variable with 
    code scss/_user-variables.scss
    | , or write your own SCSS code in 
    code scss/_user.scss
    |  and add or update 
    code javaScript
    |  from 
    code src/js
    |  directory.

  .alert.alert-warning Running the 
    code gulp
    |  command will discard and regenerate all the files in following directories:
  +ComponentCardLib
    |  public/**/*.html
    |  public/assets/css/
    |  public/assets/js/
    |  public/vendors

  p.mt-4 Hit 
    code Ctrl+C
    |  or just close the command line window to stop the server.

  p Happy editing!
